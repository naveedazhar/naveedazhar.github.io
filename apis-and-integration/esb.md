# ESB

An ESB, or enterprise service bus, is an architectural pattern whereby a centralized software component performs integrations between applications.  It performs transformations of data models, handles connectivity, performs message routing, converts communication protocols and potentially manages the composition of multiple requests. The ESB can make these integrations and transformations available as a service interface for reuse by new applications.&#x20;

The ESB pattern is typically implemented using a specially designed integration runtime and toolset (i.e., esb product) that ensures the best possible productivity.
