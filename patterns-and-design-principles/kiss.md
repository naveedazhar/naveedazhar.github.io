# ðŸ’‹ KISS

I always liked this one, both for the word that forms and for what it means: **Keep It Simple Stupid** (or if you donâ€™t like to be called stupid, you can think of it as **Keep It Stupid Simple**, which I think works even better for the actual meaning of the acronym).

Sometimes, when solving a problem, you might incur in what is known as over-engineering or how I like to call it: using a bazooka to kill a mosquito. Itâ€™ll get the job done, but you can definitely do the same thing a lot simpler.

There are moments when complexity is required, donâ€™t get me wrong. When simple code, or a simple architecture is definitely not useful, adding complexity to your logic is required. However, more often than not, you should ask yourself whether youâ€™re KISSâ€™ing it or not.

Or rather, are your logic paths simple enough? What is the cognitive load required to understand them? Simple code, or simple design in general, means youâ€™re less prone to errors and those trying to understand it should have an easier time doing so. So in general, remember to KISS your code.
