# YAGNI

Otherwise known as “You ain’t gonna need it” is a principle taken from [eXtreme Programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/) that argues that you should not build functionality in advance, or rather, until you actually need it.

The point being that within an [agile development framework](https://medium.com/agileinsider/the-agile-developers-survival-guide-for-2020-be6621560188), you should only focus on your current work iteration and not in the ones to come. This is because even though it might sound tempting to work ahead of time and deliver more functionality that you were expecting, the changing nature of the agile workflow makes the future unstable.

What do I mean by unstable? I mean that given the short-iterations that characterize this methodology, you can receive early feedback, potentially completely changing the future of your project and rendering that feature you delivered without needing, useless.

Of course, the same train of thought does not apply for waterfall environments, where you plan ahead of time and try to follow that same plan without deviations. In such environments, YAGNI wouldn’t apply.
