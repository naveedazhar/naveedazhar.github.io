# Challenges in cloud development



| [![Data management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/\_images/category/data-management.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/data-management)                       | <h4><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/data-management">Data Management</a></h4><p>Data management is the key element of cloud applications, and it influences most of the quality attributes. Data is typically hosted in different locations and across multiple servers for performance, scalability or availability. This can present various challenges. For example, data consistency must be maintained, and data will typically need to be synchronized across different locations.</p>                               |

Decisions made during the design and implementation phase significantly impact the quality and total cost of ownership of cloud-hosted applications and services.</p> |

Asynchronous messaging is widely used and provides many benefits, but it also brings challenges such as ordering messages, poison message management, idempotency, and more.</p>                                                                                          |
