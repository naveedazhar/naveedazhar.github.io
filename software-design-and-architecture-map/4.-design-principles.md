# 4. Design Principles

At this point, you're understanding that Object-Oriented Programming is very useful for encapsulating rich domain models and solving the [3rd type of "Hard Software Problems"- Complex Domains](https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/3-categories-of-hard-software-problems/).

But OOP can introduce some design challenges.

When should I use composition?

When should I use inheritance?

When should I use an abstract class?

Design principles are really well-established and battle-tested object-oriented best practices that you use as railguards.

Some examples of common design principles you should familiarize yourself with are:

* Composition over inheritance
* Encapsulate what varies
* Program against abstractions, not concretions
* The hollywood principle: "Don't call us, we'll call you"
* The [SOLID principles](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/solid-principles/solid-typescript/), especially the [Single responsibility principle](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/solid-principles/single-responsibility/)
* DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself)
* [YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)](https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/yagni/)

Make sure to come to your _own_ conclusions, though. Don't just follow what someone else says you should do. Make sure that it makes sense to you.
