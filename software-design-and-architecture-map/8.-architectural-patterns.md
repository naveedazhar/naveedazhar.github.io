# 8. Architectural Patterns

Architectural _patterns_ explain in greater tactical detail how to actually implement one of those architectural _styles_.

Here are a couple of examples of architectural patterns and the styles that they inherit from:

* [**Domain-Driven Design**](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/domain-driven-design-intro/) is an approach to software development against really complex problem domains. For DDD to be most successful, we need to implement a **layered architecture** in order to separate the concerns of a domain model from the infrastrural details that makes the application actually run, like databases, webservers, caches, etc.
* **Model-View Controller** is probably the most well-known architectural pattern for developing user interface-based applications. It works by dividing the app into 3 components: model, view, and controller. MVC is incredibly useful when you're first starting out, and it helps you piggyback towards other architectures, but there hit's a point when we realize [MVC isn't enough](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/when-crud-mvc-isnt-enough/) for problems with lots of business logic.
* **Event sourcing** is a functional approach where we store only the transactions, and never the state. If we ever need the state, we can apply all the transactions from the beginning of time.
