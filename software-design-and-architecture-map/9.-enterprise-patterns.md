# 9. Enterprise patterns

Any architectural pattern you choose will introduce a number of constructs and technical jargon to familiarize yourself with and decide on whether it's worth the effort to use or not.

Taking an example that many of us know, in **MVC**, the _view_ holds all the presentation layer code, the _controller_ is translates commands and queries from the _view_ into requests that are handled by the _model_ and returned by the _controller_.

Where in the Model (M) do we handle these things?:

* validation logic
* invariant rules
* domain events
* use cases
* complex queries
* and business logic

If we simply use an ORM (object-relational mapper) like [Sequelize](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/software-design/) or [TypeORM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/software-design/) as the _model_, all that important stuff to gets left to interpretation on where it should go, and it finds itself in some unspecified layer between (what should be a rich) _model_ and the _controller_.

If there's something I've learned so far in my journey going beyond MVC, it's that **there is a construct for everything**.

For each of those things that MVC fails to address, there exist other **enterprise patterns** to solve them. For example:

* [**Entities**](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/entities/) describe models that have an identity.
* [**Value Objects**](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-value-object/) are models that have no identity, and can be used in order to encapsulate validation logic.
* [**Domain Events**](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/typescript-domain-driven-design/chain-business-logic-domain-events/) are events that signify some relevant business event occurring, and can be subscribed to from other components.

Depending on the architectural style you've chosen, there are going to be a ton of other enterprise patterns for you to learn in order to implement that pattern to it's fullest potential.
