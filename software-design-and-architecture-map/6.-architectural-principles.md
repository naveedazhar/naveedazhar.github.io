# 6. Architectural Principles

Now we're at a higher level of thinking beyond the class level.

We now understand that the decisions we make towards organzing and building relationships between components at the high-level and the low-level, will have a significant impact on the maintainability, flexibility, and testability of our project.

Learn the guiding principles that helps you build in the flexibility that your codebase needs in order to be able to react to new features and requirements, with as little effort as possible.

Here's what I'd recommend learning right off the bat:

* Component design principles: [The Stable Abstraction Principle](https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/stable-abstraction-principle/), [The Stable Dependency Principle](https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki/stable-dependency-principle/), and The Acyclic Dependency Principle, for how to organize components, their dependencies, when to couple them, and the implications of accidentally creating dependency cycles and relying on unstable components.
* [Policy vs. Detail](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/clean-nodejs-architecture/), for understanding how to separate the rules of your application from the implementation details.
* Boundaries, and how to identify the [subdomains](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/application-layer-use-cases/) that the features of your application belongs within.

Uncle Bob discovered and originally documented many of these principles, so the best resource to learn about this is again, "[Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=asc\_df\_0132350882/?tag=googleshopc0c-20\&linkCode=df0\&hvadid=292982483438\&hvpos=1o2\&hvnetw=g\&hvrand=13521899336201370454\&hvpone=\&hvptwo=\&hvqmt=\&hvdev=c\&hvdvcmdl=\&hvlocint=\&hvlocphy=9000834\&hvtargid=pla-435472505264\&psc=1)".
