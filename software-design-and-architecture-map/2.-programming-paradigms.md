# 2. Programming Paradigms



Now that we're writing readable code that's easy to maintain, it would be a good idea to really understand the 3 major programming paradigms and the way they influence how we write code.

In Uncle Bob's book, "[Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=asc\_df\_0132350882/?tag=googleshopc0c-20\&linkCode=df0\&hvadid=292982483438\&hvpos=1o2\&hvnetw=g\&hvrand=13521899336201370454\&hvpone=\&hvptwo=\&hvqmt=\&hvdev=c\&hvdvcmdl=\&hvlocint=\&hvlocphy=9000834\&hvtargid=pla-435472505264\&psc=1)", he brings attention to the fact that:

* Object-Oriented Programming is the tool best suited for defining how we cross architectural boundaries with polymorhpism and plugins
* Functional programming is the tool we use to push data to the boundaries of our applications
* and Structured programming is the tool we use to write algorithms

This implies that effective software uses a hybrid all 3 programming paradigms styles at different times.

While you _could_ take a strictly functional or strictly object-oriented approach to writing code, understanding where each excels will improve the quality of your designs.
