# 1. Clean code

The very first step towards creating long-lasting software is figuring out how to write **clean code**.

Clean code is code that is easy to understand and change. At the low-level, this manifests in a few design choices like:

* being consistent
* preferring meaningful variable, method and class names over writing comments
* ensuring code is indented and spaced properly
* ensuring all of the tests can run
* writing pure functions with no side effects
* not passing null

Writing clean code is incredibly important.

Think of it like a game of jenga.

In order to keep the structure of our project stable over time, things like indentation, small classes and methods, and meaningful names, pay off a lot in the long run.

The best resource to learn how to write clean code is Uncle Bob's book, "[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)".
