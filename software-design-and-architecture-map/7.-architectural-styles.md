# 7. Architectural Styles



Architecture is about the stuff that matters.

It's about identifying what a system needs in order for it to be successful, and then stacking the odds of success by choosing the architecture that best fits the requirements.

For example, a system that has a lot of **business logic complexity** would benefit from using a **layered architecture** to encapsulate that complexity.

A system like Uber needs to be able to handle a lot of **real time-events** at once and update drivers' locations, so **publish-subscribe** style architecture might be most effective.

I'll repeat myself here because it's important to note that the 3 categories of architectural styles are similar to the 3 categories of design patterns, because **architectural styles are design patterns at the high-level**.

#### Structrual <a href="#structrual" id="structrual"></a>

Projects with _varying levels_ of components and wide-ranging functionality will either benefit or suffer from adopting a structural architecture.

Here are a few examples:

* **Component-based** architectures emphasize separation of concerns between the _individual components_ within a system. Think **Google** for a sec. Consider how many applications they have within their enterprise (Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Maps, etc). For platforms with lots of functionality, component-based architectures divide the concerns into loosely coupled independent components. This is a _horizontal_ separation.
* **Monolithic** means that the application is combined into a single platform or program, deployed altogether. _Note: You can have a component-based AND monolithic architecture if you separate your applications properly, yet deploy it all as one piece_.
* **Layered** architectures separate the concerns _vertically_ by cutting software into infrastructure, application, and domain layers.

#### Messaging <a href="#messaging" id="messaging"></a>

Depending on your project, messaging might be a really important component to the success of the system. For projects like this, message-based architectures build on top of functional programming principles and behavioural design patterns like the observer pattern.

Here are a few examples of message-based architectural styles:

* **Event-Driven** architectures view all signficant changes to state as events. For example, within a [vinyl-trading app](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/white-label), a offer's state might change from "pending" to "accepted" when both parties agreee on the trade.
* **Publish-subscribe** architectures build on top of the Observer design pattern by making it the primary communication method between the system itself, end-users / clients, and others systems and components.

#### Distributed <a href="#distributed" id="distributed"></a>

A distributed architecture simply means that the components of the system are deployed separately and operate by communicating over a network protocol. Distributed systems can be very effective for scaling throughput, scaling teams, and delegating (potentially expensive tasks or) responsibility to other components.

A few examples of distributed architectural styles are:

* **Client-server** architecture. One of the most common architectures, where we divide the work to be done between the client (presentation) and the server (business logic).
* **Peer-to-peer** architectures distribute application-layer tasks between equally-privileged participants, forming a peer-to-peer network.
